# Radar-System-for-Obstacle-Detection
Components Used:

1> Arduino UNO

2> HC-SRO4 Ultra Sonic Sensor

3> TowerPro SG 90 Micro Servo Moto

4> Jumper Wires 

5> Laptop/PC


A Micro-Controller based Radar System that is useful in the detection of Obstacles upto a distance of 4 meters from the sensor. 
Here the Ultra Sonic Sensor used to control the sensors circuit is Arduino Uno. The UltraSonic Sensor employed to detect obstacles from a distance of 2 cm infront of to to 4 meters apart from it is HC-SRO4. 
In addition a Micro Servo Motor SG90 is employed so that obstacles can be detected across the 180 degrees sight of operationof the sensor.

And finally the detection of any nearby obstacle is realized by its visulaization on the visual-processing-app for HC-SRO4.
